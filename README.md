## Description

Our app allows users to upload, edit and delete their photos, as well as interact with each other by commenting and rating photos. Users also have the ability to create unique QR codes for their photos and share them with other community members, making photo sharing even more convenient and fun. They can also chat and discuss each other's photos and share the experience of processing photos with the help of [Cloudynary](https://cloudinary.com) service.

## Implementation

Once the application is running *locally*, you can browse to run it on your local host using the following links[^1]:
- To view detailed information on our project [http://localhost:8000/views/info](http://localhost:8000/views/info)
- To view detailed information on our project in `JSON` format  [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000)
- To test the connection to the database and server time information [http://localhost:8000/api/healthchecker](http://localhost:8000/api/healthchecker)

For comfortable viewing of `JSON` respone in your browser we recommend to install the extension for Google Chrome
[JSON Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh/related?hl=ru) or
[JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=ru) (according to your taste)


### API routes

The main goal of application is primarily designed to implement a REST API, which plays a key role in ensuring efficient interaction between frontend developers (React, View, Angular) and our service.

All documentation on interacting with our API is available at the following links:
- To view swagger documentation [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- To view redoc documentation [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)


### Admin Dashboard

We also tried to create routes on FastAPI that implement not only API routes, but also SSR (Server Side Rendering) technology to make your web pages more easily available to users.

Links to view images uploaded by service users can be found here:
- To start using pur aplication type [http://localhost:8000/views/dashboard](http://localhost:8000/views/dashboard)

### Chat

Also our app is equipped with a chat for short messaging via websocket. The chat is available at the link:
-  [http://localhost:8000/views/chat](http://localhost:8000/views/chat)


## Information for Developers

Our project is equipped with Sphinx documentation, which you can find at [https://sergiokapone.github.io/SnapshotExchange/](https://sergiokapone.github.io/SnapshotExchange/). The documentation may be useful to other developers who
can use it to develop our project.
